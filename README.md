## A quick exercise in JavaScript's objects

For this study, i've created an object that represents a restaurant's website application for inputting data on their daily specials.

The user has to input a valid meal name, followed by a valid price for said meal. The inputs run through setter methods, and can be visualized as a return for a getter method

For execution, i also built a function and destructualize the getter method so it could be called by a console.log() in the most clean fashion possible.
